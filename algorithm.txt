1. Random computer selection for Rock, Paper or Scissors.
2. Prompt user input --> case-insensitive.
3. Evaluate the result.
4. Display result as a message.


Side Notes: 

The idea is to write something along the lines of:

Idea(1) {
If user chooses paper and machine rock, user wins.
If user chooses paper and machine scissors, user loses.
If uses choses paper and machine aswell, it's a draw.

If user choses rock and machine scissors, user wins.
If user choses rock and machin paper, user loses.
If they choose the same, it's a draw.

If user choses scissors and machine paper (win), 
rock (loss), scissors (draw).
}

The question is can I write that easier.
Let's say I focus on the basic concept of the game:

Idea(2) {

Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
Same choice = draw.

If user chose element that won, displax Victory.
If user chose element that lost, display Defeat.
If they chose the same, display Draw.
}
So I have to change it up.
I missed that the message is supposed to display
why you won or lost. 
Like so "You Lose! Paper beats Rock".


Now I have to loop the playRound function 5 times, 
keep Score and declare a winner at the end.
